##Rows
The rows are identified by the number of the test person (1-3), followed by the activity:
- laying
- sitting
- standing
- walking
- walking_downstairs
- walking_upstairs

##Columns
For the columns I kept the names as described in features_info.txt. I retained only the mean() and std() values here
